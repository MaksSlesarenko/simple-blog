===========

Every developer should have his own blog, at least a code for it.

Back-end: Symfony 3

Front-end: Marionette

Try it out
==========

* Clone the project and make `vagrant up --provision`
* To look at the posts as a guest visit `http://192.168.33.11/`
* To create/update/delete posts visit `/management`
* To access it, use login `admin` and password `thekeytosuccess`

But why?
========

It can be an example of how to set up environment, make a simple
REST API and SPA for it.
